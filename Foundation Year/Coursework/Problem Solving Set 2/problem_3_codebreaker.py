# Problem 3 - Rodin Opuz
# Codebreaker



# This generates the list of prime numbers up to n.
def prime_number_list_generator(n): # This is a function that takes n as a parameter.

            for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p): # This is a for loop that starts with the value p * p, ends at n + 1 and increases p times every step.
                prime_check[i] = False #Â This is for all multiples of 2. If it is a multiple of 2, the value at index i becomes False. This means it is not a prime number.
